A collection of parametric binary black hole mass/spin population models.

These are formatted to be consistent with the [Bilby](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby) [hyper-parameter inference package](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/hyperparameters.html).

For an example using this code to analyse the first gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-1) see [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ColmTalbot/gwpopulation/blob/master/examples/GWTC1.ipynb).

Most of the models implemented are derived from models presented in one of:

- [Talbot & Thrane (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02699)
